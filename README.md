### What is this repository for? ###
##Project Description Overview##
For our project we have decided to create an enterprise application that allows users to create and join ‘rooms’ that allow for real-time location sharing between members of a room. This real-time location sharing allows for groups of people to easily share their real-time location via a url to the room which they can share with anyone, and is safely not shared once they leave the room, allowing for privacy to be maintained.

The main view of this application will be a map, zoomed to a level to show all the members of the room who are displayed by markers on the map. Additional features would be to have social integration to grab a picture and name for the user, a private (person-to-person) and public (room-wide) chat feature, and a method to be able to set your mode of transportation and calculate the estimated travel time between users.
